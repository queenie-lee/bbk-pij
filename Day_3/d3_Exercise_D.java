/* 
Write a program that reads a series of numbers from the user, until the user enters the String "END".
The program should then print how many numbers were positive, negative, or zero. Write the pro-
gram using (a) if. . . else clauses â€€1rst and then using (b) the ternary operator. Is there any difference? 
In which case it is easier to write the program? In which case does it look clearer to you?
